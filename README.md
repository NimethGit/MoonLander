# MoonLander
A small game made in 2019 as a first-year student project for the course "Linear Algebra, Trigonometry and Geometry".

The Lunar Lander genre was made popular in the 1970s. The main objective of games in the genre is to control a spaceship and try to land on the surface of an astronomical body with the help of thrusters using a limited amount of fuel.

The font that is used is called "MoonbaseOmega" and was made by Darrell Flood. 
Background music is called "MagicalPath" and unfortunately I don't remember who made it.
